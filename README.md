# Project 0 Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Live demo [here](https://rox-liu.github.io/Project0/).
